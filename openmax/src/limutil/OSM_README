what is OSM
===========

OSM, pronounced as 'awesome', stands for "One Step Make".

Yes, one and _ONLY_ one step to make your project, by typing ./osm

The idea is really simple: no matter how complicated the system is, there must
be one way or aother to chain all steps together with some sort of scripting.
It does not really matter whether it is the most efficient, or even right way.
It is one way to meet the objective: make your project make in ONE step.

It does its best to find ONE way to make the project, hassle free. And very
importantly it does not affect your host system in any regard except taking
some disk space (project varies), and osm can be completely reverted by
simply remove the 'osm-dir', the directory that contains all downloaded
supporting packages if any.



what it does
============

one step to make the project.



what it does not
================

it does not think for you, it has no brain. Your mileage varies depending
on what host system you are using, or how different your host system is from
the one used by original developers.



who should use it
=================

if you are dumb and/or lazy, as I am, give it a try.



what I do if doesn't work
=========================

report problems, get them fixed, till it becomes really 'awesome'.
